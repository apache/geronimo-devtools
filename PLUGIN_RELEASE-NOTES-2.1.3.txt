System Requirements
-------------------
1. Java J2SE 1.5.0 or greater, and a platform that supports it

2. Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers (Ganymede or Europa), which is platform-specific

   -- Get Eclipse from http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/

3. Geronimo server (2.0.x or 2.1.x)

   -- Get a Geronimo server from http://geronimo.apache.org/downloads.html



Notes
-----
You will likely need to increase the default setting for maximum PermGen size
for your Eclipse installation (especially for Sun's JDK 1.5.0_x on the Windows
platform) to prevent "java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: PermGen" errors. From the
command line you can use:

        eclipse -vmargs -Xms128m -Xmx512m -XX:MaxPermSize=128m

Or you can edit your eclipse.ini file. An example is shown below but remember
that each argument has to be on seperate lines:

        -vmargs
        -Xms128m
        -Xmx512m
        -XX:MaxPermSize=128m



Geronimo Eclipse Plugin Version 2.1.2 Enhancements
--------------------------------------------------
1. Eclipse Ganymede support (along with continued Europa support)

2. Java 1.6 runtime support (along wiht continued 1.5 runtime support)

3. Numerous enhancements the Geronimo deployment plan editors

4. "Download and Install" server feature replaced with a URL link to the Geronimo Server download page



Installation Option #1: Install from within WTP
-----------------------------------------------
There a several installation alternatives, but the easiest method is not to
download the plugin at all !! It can be installed directly from within WTP by
clicking on the "Don't see your server listed?" link when defining a server
runtime in WTP. Select it, then select Geronimo 2.1.2 and the installation
process will begin. Once the workbench restarts Geronimo 2.1.2 support will be
available.

1 -- Invoke the eclipse executable from your /eclipse directory.  Select or
     accept the default workspace.

2 -- Open the Preferences dialog:

     a. Window  --> Preferences --> Server --> Installed Runtimes --> Click
        "Add"

     b. Select "Download addtional server adapters

     c. Select the "Geronimo v2.1 Server Adapter 2.1.3" adapter

     d. Select Next --> Accept the license agreement --> Next --> Finish

     e. It will then download and install the plugin artifacts (takes a few
        seconds)

     f. Select "Install All"

     g. Select Yes to restart Eclipse

3 -- Verify that the GEP was correctly installed:

     a. Help --> About Eclipse Platform

     b. Ensure that the Geronimo icon displays somewhere in the row of icons in the "About 
        Eclipse Platform" pane. If not, the GEP was not installed correctly. 

4 -- Define a new server. From Eclipse select:

     a. File --> New --> Other --> Server --> Server --> Next --> Apache. 
        At this point you must see the Apache Geronimo v2.1 Server selection
        or the plugin was not installed/unzipped correctly. 

     b. Select "Apache Geronimo v2.1 Server" --> Next --> then enter the root 
        directory of your Geronimo server installation --> Next --> Next --> 
        Next --> Finish

     c. Now in the Java EE perspective you should see the Apache Geronimo v2.1 
        server (bottom pane, middle tab usually) that you can now start in 
        Eclipse (either right-click on it and select start or select the little
        green and white arrow on the far right of the server pane). You should 
        then see the console and the familiar server startup messages.
	
     d. Right-click on the server and select "Launch Geronimo Console" to bring
        up an admin console browser window in Eclipse.



Installation Option #2: Use Eclipse Update Site
-----------------------------------------------
Alternatively, you can download both the Eclipse Plugin from the Eclipse Update 
Site. Again if you've never done this before the steps are fairly straightforward:

1 -- Invoke the eclipse executable from your /eclipse directory.  Select or
     accept the default workspace. 

2 -- Open the Eclipse Software Updates dialog:

     a. Help --> Software Updates --> Available Software

     b. On the "Available Software" tab you must add a new remote site to 
        point to the Staging site.  Click "Add Site" button --> set URL to this:
   
        http://apache.org/dist/geronimo/eclipse/updates/

     c. Expand this site and select the "Geronimo v2.1 Server Adapter" and click the
        "Install" button. You may likely have to wait a few seconds while Eclipse 
        resolves the dependencies. 

     d. Select Next --> Accept the license agreement --> Finish

     e. It will then download and install the plugin artifacts (takes a few 
        seconds)

     f. Select Yes to restart Eclipse

3 -- Verify that the GEP was correctly installed:

     a. Help --> About Eclipse Platform

     b. Ensure that the Geronimo icon displays somewhere in the row of icons in the "About 
        Eclipse Platform" pane. If not, the GEP was not installed correctly. 

4 -- Define a new server. From Eclipse select:

     a. File --> New --> Other --> Server --> Server --> Next --> Apache. 
        At this point you must see the Apache Geronimo v2.1 Server selection
        or the plugin was not installed/unzipped correctly. 

     b. Select "Apache Geronimo v2.1 Server" --> Next --> then enter the root 
        directory of your Geronimo server installation --> Next --> Next --> 
        Next --> Finish

     c. Now in the Java EE perspective you should see the Apache Geronimo v2.1 
        server (bottom pane, middle tab usually) that you can now start in 
        Eclipse (either right-click on it and select start or select the little
        green and white arrow on the far right of the server pane). You should 
        then see the console and the familiar server startup messages.
	
     d. Right-click on the server and select "Launch Geronimo Console" to bring
        up an admin console browser window in Eclipse.



Installation Option #3: Install Plugin Manually
-----------------------------------------------
You can just download the plugin itself and unzip it into the same directory
where the prereq was installed (e.g., /eclipse). If you choose this option 
you must have an installed version of the Geronimo 2.1 server somewhere on your 
system so that you can define a Geronimo Server configuration. If you've never 
done this before the steps are fairly straightforward:

1 -- Download the GEP and unzip into your /eclipse directory. You can 
     download the plugin from here: 

     http://apache.org/dist/geronimo/eclipse/2.1.3/

2 -- Invoke the eclipse executable from your /eclipse directory. Select or
     accept the default workspace. 

3 -- Verify that the GEP was correctly installed:

     a. Help --> About Eclipse Platform

     b. Ensure that the Geronimo icon displays somewhere in the row of icons in the "About 
        Eclipse Platform" pane. If not, the GEP was not installed correctly. 

4 -- Open the Java EE perspective. From within Eclipse:

     a. Close the Welcome tab

     b. Select Window --> Open Perspective --> Other --> Java EE
        You should now be in the Java EE perspective. You can see the open 
        perspective tabs in the upper right-hand corner of your Eclipse  
        workspace.

5 -- Define a new server. From Eclipse select:

     a. File --> New --> Other --> Server --> Server --> Next --> Apache. 
        At this point you must see the Apache Geronimo v2.1 Server selection
        or the plugin was not installed/unzipped correctly. 

     b. Select "Apache Geronimo v2.1 Server" --> Next --> then enter the root 
        directory of your Geronimo server installation --> Next --> Next --> 
        Next --> Finish

     c. Now in the Java EE perspective you should see the Apache Geronimo v2.1 
        server (bottom pane, middle tab usually) that you can now start in 
        Eclipse (either right-click on it and select start or select the little
        green and white arrow on the far right of the server pane). You should 
        then see the console and the familiar server startup messages.
	
     d. Right-click on the server and select "Launch Geronimo Console" to bring
        up an admin console browser window in Eclipse.

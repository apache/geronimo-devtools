\n\
      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object\n\
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the\n\
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications\n\
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes\n\
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain\n\
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,\n\
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.\n\
\n\
      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including\n\

      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,\n\
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable\n\
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their\n\
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)\n\
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You\n\
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a\n\
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work\n\
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct\n\
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses\n\
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\n\
      as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\
\n\
   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\n\
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\n\
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\n\
      meet the following conditions:\n\
\n\
      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\n\
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n\
\n\
      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\n\
          stating that You changed the files; and\n\
\n\
      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n\
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n\
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\n\
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n\
          the Derivative Works; and\n\
\n\
      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its\n\
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n\
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n\
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n\
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n\
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n\
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n\
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n\
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n\
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\n\
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n\
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n\
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n\
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n\
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n\
          as modifying the License.\n\
\n\
      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n\
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n\
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n\
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n\
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n\
      the conditions stated in this License.\n\
\n\
   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n\
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n\
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n\
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n\
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n\
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n\
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\
\n\
   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n\
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n\
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n\
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\
\n\
   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n\
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n\
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,\n\
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n\
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n\
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n\
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n\
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n\
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\
\n\
   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n\
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n\
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n\
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n\
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n\
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n\
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n\
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n\
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n\
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n\
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\
\n\
   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n\
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n\
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n\
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n\
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n\
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n\
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n\
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n\
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n\
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\

\n\
3. Distribution Obligations.\n\
\n\
3.1. Availability of Source Code.\n\
\n\
Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make available\n\
in Executable form must also be made available in Source Code form and\n\
that Source Code form must be distributed only under the terms of this\n\
License. You must include a copy of this License with every copy of\n\
the Source Code form of the Covered Software You distribute or\n\
otherwise make available. You must inform recipients of any such\n\
Covered Software in Executable form as to how they can obtain such\n\
Covered Software in Source Code form in a reasonable manner on or\n\
through a medium customarily used for software exchange.\n\
\n\
3.2. Modifications.\n\
\n\
The Modifications that You create or to which You contribute are\n\
governed by the terms of this License. You represent that You believe\n\
Your Modifications are Your original creation(s) and/or You have\n\
sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.\n\
\n\
3.3. Required Notices.  You must include a notice in each of Your\n\
Modifications that identifies You as the Contributor of the\n\
Modification. You may not remove or alter any copyright, patent or\n\
trademark notices contained within the Covered Software, or any\n\
notices of licensing or any descriptive text giving attribution to any\n\
Contributor or the Initial Developer.\n\
\n\
3.4. Application of Additional Terms.  You may not offer or impose any\n\
terms on any Covered Software in Source Code form that alters or\n\
restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients\n\
rights hereunder. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for,\n\
warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more\n\
recipients of Covered Software. However, you may do so only on Your\n\
own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any\n\
Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty,\n\
support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone,\n\
and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every\n\
Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or\n\
such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or\n\
liability terms You offer.\n\
\n\
3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.  You may distribute the\n\
Executable form of the Covered Software under the terms of this\n\
License or under the terms of a license of Your choice, which may\n\
contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in\n\
compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the\n\
Executable form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients\n\
rights in the Source Code form from the rights set forth in this\n\
License. If You distribute the Covered Software in Executable form\n\
under a different license, You must make it absolutely clear that any\n\
terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by\n\
the Initial Developer or Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify\n\
the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred\n\
by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such\n\
terms You offer.\n\
\n\
3.6. Larger Works.  You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered\n\
Software with other code not governed by the terms of this License and\n\
distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You\n\
must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the\n\
Covered Software.\n\
\n\
4. Versions of the License.\n\
\n\
4.1. New Versions.  Sun Microsystems, Inc. is the initial license\n\
steward and may publish revised and/or new versions of this License\n\
from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version\n\
number. Except as provided in Section 4.3, no one other than the\n\
license steward has the right to modify this License.\n\
\n\
4.2. Effect of New Versions.\n\
\n\
You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the\n\
Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the\n\
License under which You originally received the Covered Software. If\n\
the Initial Developer includes a notice in the Original Software\n\
prohibiting it from being distributed or otherwise made available\n\
under any subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and\n\
make the Covered Software available under the terms of the version of\n\
the License under which You originally received the Covered\n\
Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to use, distribute or\n\
otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of any\n\
subsequent version of the License published by the license steward.\n\
4.3. Modified Versions.\n\
\n\
When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new license\n\
for Your Original Software, You may create and use a modified version\n\
of this License if You: (a)·rename the license and remove any\n\
references to the name of the license steward (except to note that the\n\
license differs from this License); and (b)·otherwise make it clear\n\
that the license contains terms which differ from this License.\n\
\n\
5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.\n\
\n\
COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN AS IS BASIS,\n\
WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,\n\
WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF\n\
DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR\n\
NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF\n\
THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE\n\
DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER\n\
CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR\n\
CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART\n\
OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED\n\
HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.\n\
\n\
6. TERMINATION.\n\
\n\
6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate\n\
     automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to\n\
     cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the\n\
     breach. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect\n\
     beyond the termination of this License shall survive.\n\
\n\
6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory\n\
     judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the\n\
     Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You assert such\n\
     claim is referred to as Participant) alleging that the\n\
     Participant Software (meaning the Contributor Version where the\n\
     Participant is a Contributor or the Original Software where the\n\
     Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or indirectly\n\
     infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted directly or\n\
     indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer (if\n\
     the Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all\n\

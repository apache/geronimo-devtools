\n\
      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object\n\
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the\n\
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications\n\

      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain\n\
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,\n\
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.\n\
\n\

      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their\n\
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)\n\
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You\n\
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a\n\
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work\n\
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct\n\
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses\n\
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\n\
      as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\
\n\
   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\n\
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\n\
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\n\
      meet the following conditions:\n\
\n\
      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\n\
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n\
\n\
      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\n\
          stating that You changed the files; and\n\
\n\
      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n\
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n\
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\n\
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n\
          the Derivative Works; and\n\
\n\
      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its\n\
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n\
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n\
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n\
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n\
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n\
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n\
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n\
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n\
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\n\
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n\
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n\
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n\
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n\
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n\
          as modifying the License.\n\
\n\
      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n\
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n\
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n\
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n\
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n\
      the conditions stated in this License.\n\
\n\
   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n\
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n\
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n\
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n\
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n\
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n\
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\
\n\
   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n\
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n\
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n\
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\
\n\
   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n\
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n\
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,\n\
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n\
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n\
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n\
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n\
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n\
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\
\n\
   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n\
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n\
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n\
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n\
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n\
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n\
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n\
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n\
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n\
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n\
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\
\n\
   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n\
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n\
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n\
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n\
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n\
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n\
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n\
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n\
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n\
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\

\n\
Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make available\n\
in Executable form must also be made available in Source Code form and\n\
that Source Code form must be distributed only under the terms of this\n\
License. You must include a copy of this License with every copy of\n\
the Source Code form of the Covered Software You distribute or\n\
otherwise make available. You must inform recipients of any such\n\
Covered Software in Executable form as to how they can obtain such\n\
Covered Software in Source Code form in a reasonable manner on or\n\
through a medium customarily used for software exchange.\n\
\n\
3.2. Modifications.\n\
\n\
The Modifications that You create or to which You contribute are\n\
governed by the terms of this License. You represent that You believe\n\
Your Modifications are Your original creation(s) and/or You have\n\
sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.\n\
\n\
3.3. Required Notices.  You must include a notice in each of Your\n\
Modifications that identifies You as the Contributor of the\n\
Modification. You may not remove or alter any copyright, patent or\n\
trademark notices contained within the Covered Software, or any\n\
notices of licensing or any descriptive text giving attribution to any\n\
Contributor or the Initial Developer.\n\
\n\
3.4. Application of Additional Terms.  You may not offer or impose any\n\
terms on any Covered Software in Source Code form that alters or\n\
restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients\n\
rights hereunder. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for,\n\
warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more\n\
recipients of Covered Software. However, you may do so only on Your\n\
own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any\n\
Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty,\n\
support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone,\n\
and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every\n\
Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or\n\
such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or\n\
liability terms You offer.\n\
\n\
3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.  You may distribute the\n\
Executable form of the Covered Software under the terms of this\n\
License or under the terms of a license of Your choice, which may\n\
contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in\n\
compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the\n\
Executable form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients\n\
rights in the Source Code form from the rights set forth in this\n\
License. If You distribute the Covered Software in Executable form\n\
under a different license, You must make it absolutely clear that any\n\
terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by\n\
the Initial Developer or Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify\n\
the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred\n\
by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such\n\
terms You offer.\n\
\n\
3.6. Larger Works.  You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered\n\
Software with other code not governed by the terms of this License and\n\
distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You\n\
must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the\n\
Covered Software.\n\
\n\
4. Versions of the License.\n\
\n\
4.1. New Versions.  Sun Microsystems, Inc. is the initial license\n\
steward and may publish revised and/or new versions of this License\n\
from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version\n\
number. Except as provided in Section 4.3, no one other than the\n\
license steward has the right to modify this License.\n\
\n\
4.2. Effect of New Versions.\n\
\n\
You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the\n\
Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the\n\
License under which You originally received the Covered Software. If\n\
the Initial Developer includes a notice in the Original Software\n\
prohibiting it from being distributed or otherwise made available\n\
under any subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and\n\
make the Covered Software available under the terms of the version of\n\
the License under which You originally received the Covered\n\
Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to use, distribute or\n\
otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of any\n\
subsequent version of the License published by the license steward.\n\
4.3. Modified Versions.\n\
\n\
When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new license\n\
for Your Original Software, You may create and use a modified version\n\
of this License if You: (a)árename the license and remove any\n\
references to the name of the license steward (except to note that the\n\
license differs from this License); and (b)áotherwise make it clear\n\
that the license contains terms which differ from this License.\n\
\n\
5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.\n\
\n\

WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF\n\
DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR\n\
NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF\n\
THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE\n\
DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER\n\
CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR\n\
CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART\n\
OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED\n\
HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.\n\
\n\
6. TERMINATION.\n\
\n\
6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate\n\
     automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to\n\
     cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the\n\
     breach. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect\n\
     beyond the termination of this License shall survive.\n\
\n\
6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory\n\
     judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the\n\
     Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You assert such\n\
     claim is referred to as Participant) alleging that the\n\
     Participant Software (meaning the Contributor Version where the\n\
     Participant is a Contributor or the Original Software where the\n\
     Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or indirectly\n\
     infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted directly or\n\
     indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer (if\n\
     the Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all\n\
     Contributors under Sectionsá2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall,\n\
     upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively and\n\
     automatically at the expiration of such 60 day notice period,\n\
     unless if within such 60 day period You withdraw Your claim with\n\
     respect to the Participant Software against such Participant\n\
     either unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement with\n\
     Participant.\n\
\n\
6.3. In the event of termination under Sectionsá6.1 or 6.2 above, all\n\
     end user licenses that have been validly granted by You or any\n\
     distributor hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses\n\
     granted to You by any distributor) shall survive termination.\n\
\n\
7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.\n\
\n\
UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT\n\
(INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL\n\
DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED\n\
SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY\n\
PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES\n\
OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST\n\
PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR\n\
MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN\n\
IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\n\
DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR\n\
DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTYS NEGLIGENCE TO THE\n\
EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO\n\
NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL\n\
DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\
\n\
8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.\n\
\n\
The Covered Software is a commercial item, as that term is defined in\n\
48áC.F.R.á2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of commercial computer\n\
software (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. á252.227-7014(a)(1))\n\
and commercial computer software documentation as such terms are used\n\
in 48áC.F.R.á12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and\n\
48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all\n\
U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Software with only those\n\
rights set forth herein. This U.S. Government Rights clause is in lieu\n\
of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision\n\
that addresses Government rights in computer software under this\n\
License.\n\
\n\
9. MISCELLANEOUS.\n\
\n\

matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be\n\
unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent\n\
necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by\n\
the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice contained within the\n\
Original Software (except to the extent applicable law, if any,\n\
provides otherwise), excluding such jurisdictions conflict-of-law\n\
provisions. Any litigation relating to this License shall be subject\n\
to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the jurisdiction and\n\
venue specified in a notice contained within the Original Software,\n\
with the losing party responsible for costs, including, without\n\
limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys fees and\n\

export control laws and regulation of any other countries) when You\n\
use, distribute or otherwise make available any Covered Software.\n\
\n\
10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.\n\
\n\
As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is\n\
responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly,\n\
out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to\n\
work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such\n\
responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or\n\
shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.\n\
\n\

Common Public License - v 1.0 \n\
\n\
\n\
THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS COMMON \n\
PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE \n\
PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT. \n\
\n\
\n\
1. DEFINITIONS \n\
\n\
"Contribution" means: \n\
\n\
a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and \n\
   documentation distributed under this Agreement, and\n\
\n\
b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:\n\
\n\
i) changes to the Program, and\n\
\n\
ii) additions to the Program;\n\
\n\
where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are \n\
distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' \n\
from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor \n\
itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not \n\
include additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of \n\
software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own \n\
license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program. \n\
\n\
"Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program. \n\
\n\
\n\
"Licensed Patents " mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which \n\
are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or \n\
when combined with the Program. \n\
\n\
\n\
"Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this \n\
Agreement. \n\
\n\
\n\
"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, \n\
including all Contributors. \n\
\n\
\n\
2. GRANT OF RIGHTS \n\
\n\
a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants \n\
Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to \n\
reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly \n\
perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, \n\
if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.\n\
\n\
b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants \n\
Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under \n\
Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise \n\
transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and \n\
object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the \n\
Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by \n\
the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination \n\
to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply \n\
to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se \n\
is licensed hereunder. \n\
\n\
c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses \n\
to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any \n\
Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other \n\
intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims \n\
any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on \n\
infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to \n\
exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby \n\
assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights \n\
needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to \n\
allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility \n\
to acquire that license before distributing the Program.\n\
\n\
d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient \n\
copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license \n\
set forth in this Agreement.\n\
 \n\
3. REQUIREMENTS \n\
\n\
A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under \n\
its own license agreement, provided that: \n\
\n\
a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and\n\
\n\
b) its license agreement:\n\
   \n\
i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and \n\
conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title \n\
and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability \n\
and fitness for a particular purpose; \n\
\n\
ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for \n\
damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential \n\
damages, such as lost profits; \n\
\n\
iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered \n\
by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and\n\
\n\
iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such \n\
Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on \n\
or through a medium customarily used for software exchange. \n\
\n\
When the Program is made available in source code form: \n\
\n\
a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and \n\
\n\
b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program. \n\
\n\
Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within \n\
the Program. \n\
\n\
Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its \n\
Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent \n\
Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution. \n\
\n\
4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION \n\
\n\
Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities \n\
with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this \n\
license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the \n\
Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering \n\
should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for \n\
other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a \n\
commercial product offering, such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") \n\
hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor ("Indemnified \n\
Contributor") against any losses, damages and costs (collectively "Losses") \n\
arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third \n\
party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts \n\
or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its \n\
distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The \n\
obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating \n\
to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to \n\
qualify, \n\
an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial \n\
Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial \n\
Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, \n\
the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified \n\
Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense. \n\
\n\
\n\
For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial \n\
product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial \n\
Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, \n\
or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and \n\
warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under \n\
this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims \n\
against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and \n\
warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any \n\
damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages. \n\
\n\
\n\
5. NO WARRANTY \n\
\n\
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED \n\
ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER \n\
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR \n\
CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A \n\
PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining \n\
the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all \n\
risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement, \n\
including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, \n\
compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or \n\
equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations. \n\
\n\
\n\
6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY \n\
\n\
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY \n\
CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, \n\
SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION \n\
LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN \n\
CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) \n\
ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE \n\
EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE \n\
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. \n\
\n\
\n\
7. GENERAL \n\
\n\
If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under \n\
applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of \n\
the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action \n\
by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum \n\
extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable. \n\
\n\
\n\
If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with \n\
respect to a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or \n\
counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that \n\
Contributor to such Recipient under this Agreement shall terminate as \n\
of the date such litigation is filed. In addition, if Recipient \n\
institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim \n\
or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding \n\
combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes \n\
such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under \n\
Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. \n\
\n\
\n\
All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails \n\
to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement \n\
and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after \n\
becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this \n\
Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the \n\
Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations \n\
under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the \n\
Program shall continue and survive. \n\
\n\
\n\
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, \n\
but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may \n\
only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves \n\
the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement \n\
from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right \n\
to modify this Agreement. IBM is the initial Agreement Steward. IBM may \n\
assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable \n\
separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a \n\
distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may \n\
always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which \n\
it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is \n\
published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its \n\
Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in \n\
Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to \n\
the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether \n\
expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program \n\
not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved. \n\
\n\
\n\
This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the \n\
intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this \n\
Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year \n\
after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury \n\
trial in any resulting litigation. \n\
